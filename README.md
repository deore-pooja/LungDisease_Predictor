# LungDisease_Predictor

# Lung Image Classification

# Project Overview
This project aims to develop a machine learning model for classifying lung images into different categories, such as lung adenocarcinoma (lung_aca), normal lung (lung_n), and lung squamous cell carcinoma (lung_scc). The project is implemented using Python and various machine learning libraries, including NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, scikit-learn, OpenCV, and TensorFlow with Keras.

# Dataset
The dataset used in this project is the "lung_image_sets.zip" file, which contains the lung images organized into the following categories:

lung_aca: Lung adenocarcinoma images
lung_n: Normal lung images
lung_scc: Lung squamous cell carcinoma images

# Project Structure
The project is organized as a Jupyter Notebook, with the following steps:

1) Importing Libraries: The necessary Python libraries are imported for the project.
   
2) Extracting the Data Set: The "lung_image_sets.zip" file is extracted, and the available classes are listed.
   
3) Data Exploration: The dataset is explored, and sample images are displayed.
   
4) Data Preprocessing: The images are preprocessed, including resizing, normalization, and splitting the data into training and validation sets.
   
5) Model Definition: A machine learning model, such as a convolutional neural network (CNN), is defined for the lung image classification task.
   
6) Model Training: The model is trained on the preprocessed data, and the training process is monitored.
   
7) Model Evaluation: The trained model's performance is evaluated using various metrics, such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   
8) Model Deployment: The trained model is saved, and a discussion is provided on how to deploy the model for real-world use.
